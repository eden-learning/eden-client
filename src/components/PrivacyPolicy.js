        WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
      </h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Eden collects and uses information from
        its users, including our treatment of personally identifiable
        information. This policy does not apply to websites or the practices of
        companies that Eden does not own or control, or to individuals that Eden
        does not employ or manage, such as the third party links on the Services
        and third parties who publish their content via the Services.
      </p>
      <h2 id="link2" className="mt-5 text-center">
        HOW IS CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many
        jurisdictions, this age is 18), you may only use the Services and
        disclose information to us with your parent’s or guardian’s consent.
        Review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and make sure
        you understand it, and do the same with the privacy policies of all
        websites you visit or mobile applications you use.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only collect personal information through the Services from a child
        we know is under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 for a child in
        the European Union) (each a “child”) when we have parental consent or
        when a student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the
        terms described in more detail in the Terms of Service) to obtain
        parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose
        personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning
        environment. If you are a child, please do not send any personal
        information about yourself to us if your parent has not provided consent
        or your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior
        consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any
        personal information other than what we request from you in connection
        with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information
        from a child without appropriate consent as outlined herein, we will
        delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a
        child may have provided us personal information in violation of this
        paragraph, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we use the term “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
        are referring to personally identifiable information of individual,
        non-student registrants of the Services. References to “Children’s
        Personal Information” only apply to personally identifiable information
        of users who have registered for the Services as minor students (i.e.,
        students under the age of 18). General references to “information” apply
        to all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a student registrant and your parent or guardian has signed
        up for the Services with an Access Code provided by your teacher, you
        understand that your parent or guardian, teacher, or school
        administrator can view all information within or associated with your
        Services account, including, without limitation, messages between you
        and your teacher and grades you received on assignments.
      </p>
      <h2 id="link3" className="mt-5 text-center">
        WHAT INFORMATION DOES Eden DISPLAY OR COLLECT?
      </h2>
      <h4>Information You Provide to Us.</h4>
      <p>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the
        Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or
        that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include,
        without limitation, Personal Information such as your name, user name,
        email address, phone number, profile picture, school affiliation and
        location, billing and payment information (as it relates to purchases
        via Eden), and any other information necessary for us to provide our
        Services. If you are a student registrant, the only Children’s Personal
        Information we require is your name and user name; through the
        functionality of the Services, you may also be permitted to input a
        profile picture and an email address or phone number if you choose to
        provide that information.You can log in to our site using third-party
        sign-in services such as Office 365 or Google. These services
        authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share
        certain personal information with us, including your name and email
        address, to pre-populate our account sign-up form. If you choose to
        enable a third party to share your third-party account credentials with
        Eden, we may obtain additional information about you via that
        mechanism.If you use our referral service to tell another teacher or a
        parent about our Services, we may ask you for that person’s name, email
        address, and/or telephone number so that we can send that referral.
        Conversely, if someone provides us with information about you as part of
        the referral process, we may obtain that information from that other
        Eden user. Individuals who want Eden to delete their information can
        contact Eden at
        <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com </a>
        to request that we remove your information from our database.With your
        permission and consent, Eden may access the contact list available on
        your mobile device or in your email accounts to allow you to connect to
        your contacts on Eden and to invite them to join Eden. When you invite
        others to join Eden by using our referral page, we may send text
        messages or emails on your behalf to that person. Please understand that
        we do not use your contact list information for any purpose other than
        to send invitations or messages on your behalf and with your explicit
        consent.
      </p>
      <h4>Information Collected Automatically.</h4>
      <p>
        We receive and store certain types of usage information whenever you
        interact with the Services. For example, Eden automatically receives and
        records information on our server logs from your browser, including your
        IP address, Eden cookie information, and the page(s) you requested. We
        also record the details of your activity on the Services, and the number
        and frequency of visitors to our site and its components.When you
        download our Mobile Application, we automatically collect information on
        the type of device, name and version of the operating system, name and
        version of the application, whether the currently logged-in user is a
        teacher, student, or other user type, the numerical mobile device user
        ID, as well as actions performed by the user in accessing the Mobile
        Application (“Mobile Usage Information,” which is considered part of
        “usage information” as described above). We do not, however, ask you
        for, access, or track any geographic, location-based information from
        your mobile device (i.e., any information regarding where your mobile
        device is located on the globe at a particular time) at any time while
        downloading or using our Mobile Applications. For clarity, that does not
        prevent us from asking you what school you are affiliated with.We also
        use third-party mobile analytics software to allow us to better
        understand the functionality of our Mobile Application and Mobile Site
        on your phone. This software may record information such as how often
        you use the Mobile Application, the events that occur within the Mobile
        Application, aggregated usage information, performance data, and where
        the application was downloaded from; this information is considered
        Mobile Usage Information.Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are
        transferred to your computer or mobile device to enable systems to
        recognize a computer or device and specify how and when pages in a site
        are visited and by how many people. Eden cookies do not collect Personal
        Information or Children’s Personal Information, and we do not combine
        the general information collected through these cookies with other
        Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information to tell us who
        you are or what your user name or email address is. Most browsers have
        an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your
        browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
        sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on
        acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly
        recommend that you leave Eden cookies activated, however, because you
        may not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ most attractive
        features without cookies enabled. Our partners, affiliates, and service
        providers, including our advertising partners, may also transmit cookies
        to your browser or device when, for example, you click on an
        advertisement that appears on the Services. The use of cookies by third
        parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we do not have access
        or control over such cookies.The Services may also contain electronic
        images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs), which
        are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze
        how the Services are used.

      <h2 id="link4" className="text-center">
        WHAT DOES EDEN USE MY INFORMATION FOR?
      </h2>
      <p>Generally</p>
      <p>
        When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, form
        relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit
        information through various channels, depending on the category of user
        (“User Category”) you are registered as, and as permitted by the
        functionality of the Services. The information we gather from users
        enables us to provide, personalize and improve our services, and allows
        users to set up a user account and profile through the Services.
      </p>
      <h4>Personal Information.</h4>
      <p>
        The Personal Information you provide also is used for such purposes as
        responding to your requests for certain information and services,
        customizing your experience, and communicating with you about the
        Services.
      </p>
      <h4>Children’s Personal Information.</h4>
      <p>
        We use the Children’s Personal Information for creating your individual
        account (which will identify you within your Limited Access Groups as
        applicable), customizing your experience, and for sending you
        notifications via the Services from your teacher, school, district,
        fellow Limited Access Group members, and from Eden (regarding your use
        of the Services) (“Notifications”). Please note that your parent or
        guardian, as well as an administrator from your school and/or district,
        can view all activity and content associated with your student account,
        including your Children’s Personal Information.
      </p>
      <h4>Your email address.</h4>
      <p>
        If you provide us your email address, we may send you email
        communications. Web beacons may also be used in some of our emails to
        let us know which emails (and which links within those emails) have been
        opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our
        customer communications. If you are a student, we will only use your
        email address to send you Notifications. If you no longer wish to
        receive emails from Eden, please click the unsubscribe link that is
        included in the footer of our emails, update your email preferences, or
        contact us at
        <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com</a>
        .Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us
        via email, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still
        govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for visiting
        this Privacy Policy from time to time to review any changes.
      </p>
      <h4>Your friend’s email address or telephone number.</h4>
      <p>
        If you provide us with another teacher’s or a parent’s name, email
        address, and/or telephone number, we will automatically send that
        individual an email inviting him or her to visit the Services. We store
        this information for the sole purpose of sending this email (and, if
        applicable, subsequent “reminder” emails) and tracking the success of
        our referral program. The referred person may contact us at
        <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com </a>
        to request that we remove this information from our database.
      </p>
      <h4>Usage Information.</h4>
      <p>
        Eden uses this type of aggregate data to enable us to figure out how
        often users use parts of the Services, so that we can make the Services
        appealing and relevant to as many users as possible, and customize and
        improve those Services. As part of our use of information, we may
        provide aggregate information to our partners (in a
        non-personally-identifiable format) about how our users use our site. We
        share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand
        how often people use our partners’ services and the Services to help
        provide you with an optimal online experience. We may link usage
        information to Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information
        that we collect through the Services, but we will only use this linked
        information internally (for example, to customize your experience), and
        will not disclose it in linked format to third parties. Additionally,
        certain usage-related information may be viewable in your user profile
        that may be displayed to other users, depending on your User Category;
        for example, a “badge” may displayed in your profile indicating that you
        have added content to your user “library,” or that you have logged into
        the Services more than a certain number of times.
      </p>
      <h4>Mobile Usage Information.</h4>
      <p>
        This information is used to determine device capabilities and usage
        trends, which allows us to better understand which devices we should
        support and what features are most frequently used. We do not link this
        information we obtain from the analytics software to any
        personally-identifying information that you submit within the mobile
        application.
      </p>
      <h4>Advertising.</h4>
      <p>
        Eden does not provide any personally-identifying information to
        advertisers or our advertising partners. Nor do we sell or rent your
        personal information to anyone for any purposes, including advertising
        or marketing. In order for us to continue to be able to provide the Eden
        Services to our users for free, Eden and our third-party advertising
        partners may serve advertisements to you when you visit our website. To
        serve those advertisements, our third-party advertising partners, such
        as Google AdX, may utilize cookies. Because the privacy of our users is
        so important to Eden, we have implemented a number of policies and
        technical measures to make sure that this advertising is done
        appropriately. Among other things, Eden is not creating behavioral
        profiles of users for advertising or marketing purposes, and we are not
        sharing personally-identifiable information, such as a user’s name,
        email address, or phone number, with third parties for advertising
        purposes.
      </p>
      <h4>Push Notifications.</h4>
      <p>
        If you use the Mobile Application, we will send push notifications to
        your mobile device in order to make you aware of certain activities that
        may occur within your account, such as when someone has entered a new
        post, when you have new notifications, or when grades have been posted.
        You may opt-out of receiving these types of communications by turning
        them off at the device level or emailing us at
        <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com.</a>
      </p>
      <h2 id="link5" className="mt-5 text-center">
        WILL Eden SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR CHILDREN’S PERSONAL
        INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information about our users
        is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your
        Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information; we may share
        your Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information in
        personally identifiable form only as described below. Again, please note
        that references to “Personal Information” only apply to personal
        information of individuals who are not students.
      </p>
      <h4>Businesses We Do Not Control.</h4>
      <p>
        In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re
        affiliated with may offer or sell items or provide services to you
        through the Services (either alone or jointly with us), including
        Third-Party Content and advertisements for third-party services and
        goods. We may, for example, work jointly with other businesses to offer
        or sell products or provide services, or we may work with third-party
        websites to enhance your online experience. These transactions or
        services may or may not be commercial in nature. We have designed the
        Services to enable you to recognize when such a business is associated
        with a transaction or service. We will share your Personal Information
        or Children’s Personal Information with such a business only to the
        extent that it is related to such transaction or service that you have
        initiated; for example, we may share your school affiliation and
        location with a Publisher of a Spotlight Resource to allow that
        Publisher to determine its tax liability in connection with such
        transaction. Such services may include the ability for you to
        automatically transmit information you input on the Services to your
        profile or account on a third-party website, or automatically to
        transmit information you input on a third-party website to your Services
        profile. We have no control over the policies and practices of
        third-party websites or companies as to privacy or anything else, so
        please review all third-party websites’ policies before disclosing any
        Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information or other content
        on the Services or on any third-party website (via the automatic
        transmissions discussed above or otherwise). Eden does prohibit
        Publishers from collecting or using any information beyond what Eden
        itself collects and uses pursuant to its Privacy Policy, but that does
        not mean that we are responsible for reviewing or verifying the accuracy
        of any Publisher’s data collection or use policies.
      </p>
      <h4>Service Providers.</h4>
      <p>
        We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and
        need to share your information with them to provide products or services
        to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, processing
        payment, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently,
        Eden’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or
        Children’s Personal Information we share with them beyond what is
        necessary to assist us.
      </p>
      <h4>User Profiles.</h4>
      <p>
        If your User Category allows it, you may choose to populate your user
        profile on the Services with Personal Information or Children’s Personal
        Information, including, without limitation, your name, photograph, and
        school affiliation. This user profile information will be displayed to
        other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or
        facilitate interaction with Eden. If you are a student, the only users
        who may view your profile are those who belong to your Limited Access
        Group(s). However, please keep in mind that information (whether
        Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information or not) or
        content that you voluntarily disclose online (in “communities,” your
        Limited Access Groups, to your connections, in comments to our blog,
        etc.) becomes available to other users and can be collected and used by
        others, in accordance with the privacy settings you select in your
        account preferences, or in accordance with the User Category to which
        you belong. Any images, captions or other content that you submit to the
        Services in a manner any other user can view may be redistributed
        through the Internet and other media channels. For example, if you are a
        student, the content you contribute in your Limited Access Group(s) will
        be displayed to other members of that Limited Access Group; we cannot,
        however, control what members of your Limited Access Group will do with
        such content after you have disclosed it. Your name may be displayed to
        other users when you upload images or videos or send messages through
        the Services and other users can contact you through messages and

      <p>
        As part of the Services, you may receive from Eden (depending on your
        User Category) email or other types of communication relating to your
        use of the Services or your user profile. You acknowledge and agree that
        by posting information on the Services or otherwise using the Services,
        Eden and its agents may send you email, contact you, or engage in other
        communications that they determine relate to your profile or use of the
        Services. If you disclose your email address to Eden, depending on your
        User Category, we may use it to send updates, a newsletter, or other
        news regarding the Services, or simply to send Notifications. If you are
        a student, Eden only uses your email address or phone number to send you
        Notifications.

      <h4>Business Transfers.</h4>
      <p>
        If Eden, or some or all of its assets, were acquired or otherwise
        transferred, or in the unlikely event that Eden goes out of business or
        enters bankruptcy, user information may be transferred to or acquired by
        a third party; any such third party will be subject to the same
        commitments for previously collected Personal Information or Children’s
        Personal Information as Eden is under this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h4>Protection of Eden and Others.</h4>
      <p>
        We may release Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information
        when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with
        the law (such as to comply with a subpoena); enforce or apply our Terms
        of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
        safety of Eden, our employees, our users, or others. We will try to give
        you notice if we release information for these reasons, but please
        understand that we reserve the right not to, as it may not be practical,
        legal, or safe to do so.

        IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your Eden account Personal Information or Children’s Personal
        Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security, as
        well as by numerous other technical, administrative, and physical
        security mechanisms. We also use coding practices that take steps to
        prevent attacks on our Services from web browsers and malicious scripts,
        by processing all actions through several permission verifications
        checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may help protect against unauthorized access to your account and
        Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information by selecting and
        protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
        computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing
        your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) in
        our Credit purchasing process, we encrypt the transmission of that
        information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

      <p>
        Eden endeavors to keep your information private; however, we cannot
        guarantee security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
        failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user
        information. For additional information about the security measures we
        use in connection with the Services, please contact us at

        months. We do share certain personal information with other entities as

        under California law. For example, we may need certain information for
