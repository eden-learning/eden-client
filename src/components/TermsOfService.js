        IMPORTANT! If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in
        many places, this is 18 years old), then you must get your parent or
        guardian to read these terms and agree to them for you, before you use
        Eden or provide any information to us. Please review this agreement with
        your parent or guardian so that you both understand how Eden works and
        what restrictions apply to your use of our websites and services.
        Remember, always get an adult’s permission before going online.

          Thanks for using Eden! We’re glad you’re here, but there are some
          rules you need to agree to before you use our websites and services
          (“Services”). When we use the word “Services,” we mean not only the
          Eden.com website, but also all the other websites, products, services
          and applications made available by Eden (for example, the Eden Android
          app available via the Android Marketplace, and the Eden iPhone and
          iPad apps available at the Apple App Store). If you have any
          questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the
          Services, please contact us at{' '}

          <strong>This is a contract, right?</strong>
          <br />
          Yep – you’ve done your homework! These Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
          are a binding contract between you and Eden, Inc. (“Eden,” and
          sometimes, when we’re feeling especially friendly, “we” and “us”). You
          must agree and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to
          use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you
          agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect
          while you use the Services.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          These Terms include the provisions in this document, and in the Eden
          Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, DMCA Takedown Policy, Eden
          Store Policies, and Apple Application Terms (don’t worry – each of
          those is explained in more detail below).
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Our Services are constantly changing, to keep up with the dynamic
          needs of learners everywhere – so, these Terms might need to change,
          too. If they do change, we will do our best to tell you in advance by
          placing a notification on the Eden.com website, or we might send you
          an email. In certain situations (for example, where a change to the
          Terms is necessary to comply with legal requirements), we may not be
          able to give you advance notice. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be
          provided in advance, as described here.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          If you don’t like the new Terms, you are free to reject them –
          unfortunately, that means you won’t be able to use the Services
          anymore. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the
          Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all
          of the Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
          modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
          signed by both you and us.

          <strong>Do you care about my privacy?</strong>
          <br />
          Eden takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the entire
          current Eden Privacy Policy, please click here, but we’ve included
          some information below related to the Children’s Online Privacy and
          Protection Act (“COPPA”), because we get a lot of questions about
          that:
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent
          before they collect personally identifiable information online from
          children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal
          information through the Services from a child under 13 where that
          student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms
          described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for
          that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to
          us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a
          student under 13, please do not send any personal information about
          yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not
          obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please
          do not send any personal information other than what we request from
          you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected
          personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent
          being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if
          we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information
          beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that
          information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student
          under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of
          this paragraph, please contact us at learnwitheden@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant
          that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that
          you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians
          whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are
          responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and
          described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users
          may collect and use information of users of Eden’s Services. When
          obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our
          Privacy Policy; you can find a sample permission slip here. You must
          keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.
          For more information on COPPA, please click here. If you are a
          teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and
          authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as
          part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you
          represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf
          of your school and/or district.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          <strong>What are the basics of using Eden?</strong>
          <br />
          First, you have to sign up for an account, and select a password and
          user name (“Eden User ID”). Also, if you are a school or district, you
          may be permitted to register a school or district “subdomain” within
          Eden.com (an “Eden Subdomain”). You promise to provide us with
          accurate, complete, and updated registration information about
          yourself. You can’t select for your Eden User ID a name that you don’t
          have the rights to use or another person’s name with the intent to
          impersonate that person, nor can you select an Eden Subdomain name
          that you don’t have the right to use. In certain situations, your Eden
          User ID may be selected for you by your school or district; the same
          rules apply to them when they select an Eden User ID for you. You may
          not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written
          permission.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          If you are a school, district, or teacher, Eden will generate an
          access code for you to use with each limited access group you
          administer (an “Access Code”). For example, if you wished to establish
          a closed group amongst yourself, as a teacher, and your 5th grade
          class, you would distribute the Access Code only to those members of
          your 5th grade class that you wanted to view what was going on within
          that group. Everyone to whom a group administrator distributes the
          Access Code to will be a member of that “Limited Access Group.”
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding
          contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s
          permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to
          agree to these Terms on your behalf, as we described earlier). If
          you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity
          (for example, if you’re an administrator agreeing to these Terms on
          behalf of your district), you represent and warrant that you are
          authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s
          behalf and bind them to these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          You promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal,
          non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies
          with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is
          prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the
          Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for you using the Services
          in a way that breaks the law.

        <p className="mx-3">
          <strong>
            Also, your use of the Services is subject to our Acceptable Use
            Policy, which outlines what you can and can’t do with and on the

              The materials displayed or performed on the Services (including,
              but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photos, images,
              illustrations, User Submissions (defined below), and so forth)
              (the “Content”) are protected by copyright and other intellectual

              trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any
              Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy,

              the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way
              that violates someone else’s (including Eden’s) rights. For
              example, if someone shares a really creative lesson plan with you
              on Eden, that doesn’t mean you can print it out and start
              distributing it to other people – unless the owner specifically
              told you in writing that you could.
              <br />
              You understand that Eden owns the Services. You won’t modify,
              publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of,

              Services.
              <br />
              The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content;
              please remember that just because this functionality exists,
              doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply.

            <b>2. User Submission</b>
            <p className="mx-3">
              Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide
              through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User
              Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your
              User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to
              enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in
              those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following
              licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they
              relate to User Submissions that are also your
              personally-identifiable information.
              <br />
              For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Eden a license to
              translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure
              your content is viewable on your iPhone as well as your computer)
              and reproduce such User Submission, in each case to enable us to
              operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a
              license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
              <br />
              If you store a User Submission in your own personal Eden account,
              in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a
              “Personal User Submission”), you grant Eden the license above, as
              well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your
              Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that
              Personal User Submission to you and providing you the Services
              necessary to do so.
              <br />
              If you share a User Submission only within a Limited Access Group,
              or otherwise in a manner that only certain specified users can
              view (for example, a private message to one or more other users)
              (each, a “Limited Access User Submission”), then you grant Eden
              the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and
              distribute your Limited Access User Submission for the sole
              purpose of displaying that Limited Access User Submission to other
              members of that Limited Access Group (or to such specified users,
              as applicable) and providing you the Services necessary to do so.
              Also, you grant the other members of that Limited Access Group (or
              such specified users, as applicable) a license to access that
              Limited Access User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights
              in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services. For
              example, if you share a worksheet (that can be completed through
              the Services) with students in your Limited Access Group, you
              grant your students the rights necessary to view that worksheet
              and fill it out, and return it to you.
              <br />
              If you share a User Submission in a public “community” or “topic”
              on the Services or in a manner that more than just you or your
              Limited Access Group can view (a “Public User Submission”), then
              you grant Eden the license above, as well as a license to display,
              perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the
              purpose of displaying that Public User Submission to all Eden
              users and providing you the Services necessary to do so, as well
              as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in
              that Public User Submission in connection with Eden, provided that
              Eden will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission
              for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you
              grant all other users of the Services a license to access that
              Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it,
              as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
              <br />
              You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free,
              irrevocable, and worldwide, for as long as your User Submissions
              are stored with us. When you delete your Eden account, we will
              stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if
              applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be
              possible to completely delete this from Eden’s records, and that
              your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent
              that they were copied or stored by other users.
              <br />
              Finally, you understand and agree that Eden, in performing the
              required technical steps to provide the Services to our users
              (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions
              to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical
              requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media.

          privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit
          or utilize.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Eden has no control over and assumes no responsibility for, the
          content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions
          expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you
          interact with through the Services. In addition, Eden will not and
          cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party
          site or service (including without limitation the Publisher Software).
          By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and
          all liability arising from your use of any third party website or
          service.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or
          through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or
          services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or
          representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you
          and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever
          investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with
          any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties
          (including without limitation Publishers). You agree that Eden shall
          not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort
          incurred as the result of any such dealings.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between
          users and any third party, you agree that Eden is under no obligation
          to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or
          more other users, you release Eden, its officers, employees, agents,
          and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or
          nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or
          undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes
          and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and
          hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A
          general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not
          know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
          release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his
          settlement with the debtor.”
        </p>
        <strong>Will Eden ever change the Services?</strong>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Eden is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over
          time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services,
          or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features
          or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give
          you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would
          adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we
          reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time,
          for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you
          contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any
          reason, and without notice.
        </p>
        <strong>Does Eden cost anything?</strong>
        <p className="mx-3">
          The basic Eden Services are free and always will be – that is, we
          don’t charge for signing up for a basic, individual Eden account, or
          for a basic school or district subdomain. However, we may offer
          certain premium products and services for a fee, including software
          available through the Eden Store. This does not mean that if you’re
          currently using one of the basic accounts described above, that we’ll
          “reclassify” it as premium account in the future and start charging
          you to use it.
        </p>
        <strong>Tell me more about Third-Party Content.</strong>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Depending on the type of user account you have registered for, you may
          be able to download or use content from third-party publishers
          (“Third-Party Content”), which can be incorporated into your Eden
          experience. Student accounts are currently not permitted or enabled to
          access Third Party Content unless the Publisher authorizes student
          accounts to access such Third-Party Content. However, at some time in
          the future, Eden may make Third Party Content available to students.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Although you can download and access Third-Party Content through the
          Services, please note that the Third-Party Content is being provided
          by a third party (a “Publisher”) and not by Eden, so we don’t have any
          control over or responsibility for the content, safety, privacy, or
          security of any Third Party Content, third party application, service
          or website. In addition to these Terms with respect to Third Party
          Content, your download or use of Third-Party Content is governed by
          the terms of any agreement between you and the applicable Publisher
          offering such Third-Party Content, where applicable. Eden prohibits
          Publishers from collecting or using any information beyond what Eden
          itself collects and uses pursuant to its Privacy Policy, but this does
          not mean we are responsible for reviewing or verifying the accuracy of
          any Publisher’s data collection or use policies. In cases where
          Publisher’s Third-Party Content collects user data, each Publisher
          should have its own data collection and use policies (separate from
          Eden’s own Privacy Policy), so please review those carefully as well
          before you opt to use any Third-Party Content.
        </p>
        <strong>Use of Third-Party Content</strong>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Third-Party Content is curated by Eden. In some cases, Third-Party
          Content is provided by Eden and in other cases Third-Party Content is
          provided by others. In some cases, Third-Party Content may have
          certain restrictions on your use of the Third-Party Content in
          addition to these Terms; if there are any such additional terms, they
          will be stated in the listing for the applicable Third-Party Content,
          and you must abide by all such restrictions. In addition to any
          restrictions imposed by the Publisher, Eden requires you to: (i) use
          the Third-Party Content only for your non-commercial, educational use;
          (ii) only distribute the Third-Party Content to students who are
          currently enrolled in courses you teach; (iii) not transfer the
          Third-Party Content to any other teacher or administrator without the
          permission of the Publisher; and (iv) use reasonable efforts to ensure
          that students in your classes don’t use the Third-Party Content for
          anything other than their own non-commercial, educational use. Any
          other applicable restrictions set forth in these Terms also apply to
          your use of the Third-Party Content.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Eden cannot guarantee, and is not responsible in any manner for, the
          quality or accuracy of the Third-Party Content or the listing for the
          Third-Party Content. For clarity, the disclaimers and limitations on
          Eden’s responsibility and liability for products or services offered
          by a Publisher that are described in the Terms of Service apply to
          Third-Party Content and your interactions with Publishers. With regard
          to Third-Party Content, you may only contact a Publisher if the
          Publisher has provided contact information in their listing of the
          Third-Party Content. Eden unfortunately can’t control a Publisher’s
          responses to you, and it isn’t responsible if a Publisher doesn’t
          communicate with you in a manner that meets your expectations. That
          said, if you have any issues with a Publisher please let us know by
          contacting us at
{' '}
          <a href="mailto:learnwitheden@gmail.com"> learnwitheden@gmail.com </a>
          , or by submitting a review of the Publisher or the Third-Party
          Content on its listing page.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Where the Services allow for reviews of Third-Party Content, anyone
          who has accessed a Third-Party Content item is eligible to post a
          review and rate that item. If you submit a review, you cannot submit
          any content that violates the Acceptable Use Policy, and you are also
          prohibited from submitting anything that consists of or contains
          software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation,
          chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” Eden reserves the
          right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content but does
          not regularly review posted content. If you do post a review, you
          grant Eden a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and
          fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
          translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such
          content throughout the world in any media, and you grant Eden and any
          sublicensee the right to use the name that you submit in connection
          with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you
          own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you
          post and that the content is accurate. Eden takes no responsibility
          and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third
          party.
        </p>
        <strong>Publishers</strong>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Where the Services allow you to publish Third-Party Content, published
          Third-Party Content is subject to Eden’s approval. Your Third-Party
          Content may be rejected or removed from the Service at any time, in
          Eden’s sole discretion, including, but not limited to, if it fails to
          meet Eden’s standards of educational quality or if it contains
          inappropriate material or your conduct is inconsistent with these
          Terms. Third-Party Content must be provided in one of the file formats
          accepted at the time of upload (which may be subject to change without
          notice). Each item of Third-Party Content made available on the
          Service must be contained completely within the download offered, and
          no part of such Third-Party Content may be delivered separately or
          require an additional purchase, including without limitation, through
          sites or services not offered by or via Eden.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          Eden will allow for the download of the Third-Party Content you make
          available on the Service and does not place any restrictions on use of
          the Third-Party Content except to the limited extent set forth in
          these Terms. If you wish to bind users to any additional license
          terms, we may provide you with the option explicitly to state such
          terms in the listing for the applicable Third-Party Content, provided
          such terms must be no less protective of Eden than those herein, must
          afford users at least the rights described below, and must not be
          inconsistent with these Terms of Service. For the sake of clarity, any
          such license must allow a user who download the Third-Party Content to
          use and exploit the Third-Party Content in connection with any class,
          course, or lessons taught by that user. All Third-Party Content
          licenses must also be non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, and
          royalty-free. You understand that while these Terms place certain
          restrictions on Eden users’ use of the Third-Party Content, neither
          such users nor Eden can control students’ use of the Third-Party
          Content, nor can Eden control Eden users’ use of the Third-Party
          Content.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          You are not a third-party beneficiary of Eden’s Terms of Service that
          are applicable to users of Third-Party Content, and you have no right
          to enforce those terms or to require Eden to enforce such terms. You
          acknowledge that you have read these Terms and understand the rights
          and obligations such terms place on each Eden user in connection with
          your Third-Party Content. You understand that if you do not place any
          additional license restrictions on your Third-Party Content, the only
          restrictions on the use of your Third-Party Content by Eden users are
          those set forth in Eden’s Terms of Service, which, for clarity, may
          only be enforced by Eden. Furthermore, by uploading your Third-Party
          Content, you hereby grant Eden a worldwide, non-exclusive,
          sublicensable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable
          right and license to: (a) post your Third-Party Content on the
          Service; (b) use your applicable trademarks and logos in connection
          with the distribution and of the Third-Party Content; (c) translate or
          re-format your Third-Party Content, or edit the listing description
          for such Third-Party Content, as Eden deems it necessary; and (d) to
          use your Third-Party Content on other services provided by Eden.
        </p>
        <p className="mx-3">
          By posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your
          Third-Party Content, you represent and warrant that: (a) you have the
          legal right and authority to do so; (b) the Third-Party Content does
          not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any law, statute, ordinance
          or regulation or rights of any third party, including intellectual
          property rights; (c) the Third-Party Content does not contain a virus,
          trojan horse, worm, time bomb, or other harmful computer code, file,
          or program; (d) nothing in the Third-Party Content, nor Eden’s
          offering thereof, will require payment of any kind to a third party;
          (e) you will not engage in any activity in connection with the
          Service, including the development or distribution of any Third-Party
          Content, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an
          unauthorized manner the devices, servers, networks, or other
          properties or services of Eden or any third party; (f) you will not
          engage in any activity that is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive,
          threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar,
          obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; (g) you will not engage
          in any activity that is designed to increase artificially the reviews
          or ratings of your Third-Party Content, including, but not limited to,
          submitting reviews for your own Third-Party Content, asking users to
          write favorable reviews, or using automated means to generate reviews
          and ratings for your Third-Party Content; (h) you agree that you are
          solely responsible for (and that Eden has no responsibility to you or
          to any third party for) any Third-Party Content you distribute through
          the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any
          loss or damage which Eden may suffer) by doing so.

          Account termination may result in destruction of any Content
